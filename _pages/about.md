# Hi! I'm Kareena

I am a scientist and data enthusiast who has navigated a unique journey of continuous exploration and discovery in Brain and Cognitive Sciences at MIT and beyond. My academic foundation is robust, enriched by courses like Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science, Machine Motivated Human Vision, Genetic Applications in Bioengineering, and Neural Computation. These courses have been gateways to understanding the dynamic interplay between biology and data science, shaping my outlook and expertise.

I currently hold a vital role as the sole data analyst for a small optometric business. Here, I bring my data-driven methodologies to the table, diving deep into patient data, financial strategies, and business operations to determine actionable insights that drive progress and efficiency. My journey has also seen me thrive in research environments at MIT labs, the Broad Institute, and even in space health research with NASA TRISH. Each of these experiences has been a building block, reinforcing my capability to intertwine biology and technology for innovative solutions.

My roots originate in the vibrant and biodiverse Rio Grande Valley in Texas, a community that has been a vessel for my dual passions: science and writing. My Mexican heritage and the captivating landscapes of my hometown have deeply influenced my worldview and creative expressions. A proud moment for me was when a poem I wrote under a mesquite tree was selected by the Tony Award-winning composer, Jamshied Sharifi, to be sung in the opening composition of the MIT 2021 Commencement Ceremony.

Beyond my technical work in utilizing neural networks and implementing dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA, I find solace and meaning in the synergy of words and numbers. Both are potent storytellers in their own right, and I am fascinated by their ability to form narratives that touch lives, drive change, and reveal the unseen. My journey combines data, narrative, and relentless curiosity, aiming to bridge the ever-fascinating worlds of science, technology, and the arts.

Thank you for stopping by. I am eager to connect, share stories, and explore the myriad ways we can shape a future rich in understanding, innovation, and meaningful connections.
