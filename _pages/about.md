Hello! I'm a proud alumnus of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where I earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Brain and Cognitive Sciences. 

Emerging from the rich landscapes of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas and fueled by my vibrant Mexican heritage, my academic pursuits and personal passions converge at the intersection of human health, neuroscience, biology, and the transformative power of software and data in amplifying the quality of our lives. At the heart of it, my fascination lies in understanding complex systems - be it the intricate pathways of the human brain or the expansive realm of data science. 

In addition to my core studies, I also minored in Writing, a testament to my love for poetry and modern, experimental writings. A significant milestone in my writing journey was when one of my poems was selected by the Tony Award-winning composer, Jamshied Sharifi, for the opening composition of MIT's 2021 Commencement Ceremony. This poem, which encapsulates the resilience and reflections of a year overshadowed by the pandemic, also served as an inspiration for Sharifi's poignant work.

Outside the academic realm, I have a profound appreciation for the diverse wildlife and natural beauty of the Rio Grande Valley. Exploring its various landscapes and getting up close with its unique flora and fauna is one of my cherished hobbies.

When I'm not delving into the world of cognitive sciences, writing, or immersing myself in nature, you can find me exploring the vast, interconnected world of technology, ever-curious about how it can be leveraged to address the multifaceted challenges of our time.

Thank you for stopping by, and I look forward to connecting with like-minded individuals passionate about bridging the gap between science, technology, and the arts.
